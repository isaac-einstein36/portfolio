My name is Isaac Einstein and I am a mechanical engineer born and raised in Ohio!

## Home Life
I was initially born in Cleveland, Ohio and moved to Dayton in elementary school. There I attended Centerville High School. In my time at Centerville I played the trumpet and was a varsity Cross-Country runner and team captain.

## Family
My twin sister and I are the youngest of 5 children, and all of us attended THE Ohio State University – Go Bucks! Although we now live all across the country, we make sure to come together for family trips as often as we can.

## Career Path
I knew from a young age when I took my first algebra class in 4th grade that I enjoyed math. From there, that interest continued to grow and was confirmed when I took calculus and physics in high school. From there, I knew that mechanical engineering – the ability to apply math, physics, and design into solving problems – was the right field for me.

I quickly faced the challenge of finding my niche within the broad breadth of industries encompassed in mechanical engineering. A user-centered design project my freshman year sparked my interest in R&D and early-product engineering (see more in [projects](/projects/)). 

I started my exploration into possible careers with a co-op with ExxonMobil at their main oil refinery in Baton Rouge, LA.

I then transitioned to an internship with Battelle as a business development intern in their Advanced Mission Solutions business unit. Here I gained exposure in proposals for government contracts and confirmed my future interest in business/management.

After these internships in two vastly different industries, I investigated and decided that I wanted to pursue medical devices for their innovative potential and patient-focused design. I completed two internships with Medtronic in their Cardiac Surgery R&D division in Minneapolis, MN.

## Career Goals
Based on my industry exploration through various internships, I've decided I want to start my career as an R&D engineer in the medical devices industry. I plan to leverage my design expertise. Later in my career I expect to utilize my business minor through the [Integrated Business and Engineering Program](https://engineering.osu.edu/integrated-business-engineering-honors-program) and shift from engineering to a more management focused role.

## Other Interests
### Guitar
In my free time, I enjoy playing the acoustic guitar. I've been an avid guitar player for 8 years and favor fingerstyle guitar as shown below.

### Triathlons
I've also transitioned from running to triathlons. I've completed Ironman 70.3 Michigan and am training for Ironman Arizona this fall.
