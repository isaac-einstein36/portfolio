My name is Isaac Einstein and I am a mechanical engineer born and raised in Ohio!

## Home Life
I was initially born in Cleveland, Ohio and moved to Dayton in elementary school. I attended Centerville High School, where I played trumpet and served as a varsity Cross-Country captain.

## Family
My twin sister and I are the youngest of 5 children, and all of us attended THE Ohio State University – Go Bucks! Although we now live all across the country, we make sure to come together for family trips as often as we can.

## Career Path
I knew from a young age when I took my first algebra class in 4th grade that I enjoyed math. From there, that interest continued to grow and was confirmed when I took calculus and physics in high school.That solidified my decision to pursue mechanical engineering – a field where I could apply math, physics, and design to solve real-world problems.

I quickly faced the challenge of finding my niche within the broad breadth of industries encompassed in mechanical engineering. My freshman-year user-centered design project sparked a strong interest in R&D and early-stage product development (see more in [projects](/projects/)). 

I started my exploration into possible careers with a **co-op with ExxonMobil** at their main oil refinery in Baton Rouge, LA.

I then transitioned to an **internship with Battelle** as a business development intern in their Advanced Mission Solutions business unit. There I gained exposure in proposals for government contracts and confirmed my future interest in business/management.

After exploring two vastly different industries, I was drawn to medical devices for their innovation and patient-centered design. I completed **two internships with Medtronic** in their Cardiac Surgery R&D division in Minneapolis, MN.

## Career Goals
Based on my industry exploration through various internships, I've decided I want to start my career as an R&D engineer in the medical devices industry. I plan to leverage my design expertise. Later in my career I expect to utilize my business minor through the [Integrated Business and Engineering Program](https://engineering.osu.edu/integrated-business-engineering-honors-program) and shift from engineering to a more management focused role.

## Other Interests
### Guitar
In my free time, I enjoy playing the acoustic guitar. I've been an avid guitar player for 8 years and favor fingerstyle guitar as shown below.

### Triathlons
I've also transitioned from running to triathlons. I've completed Ironman 70.3 Michigan and am training for Ironman Arizona this fall.
